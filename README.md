Based on Valentin Haddad´s Financial Risk Management Class

Defining and managing risk is one of the most important challenges that firms face daily. This is particularly crucial for financial institutions that rely on leverage.

One important question to consider is: 'What is realistically the worst that could happen over one day, one week, or one year?'

Value-at-Risk (VaR) provides an answer to this question by defining 'realistically' as an outcome so severe that anything worse is highly unlikely.

Concepts and possible uses

1) Value-at-Risk
2) Measuring VaR: Back-testing and Historical Simulations

Quantitative risk management emerged as a distinct discipline of financial economics in the 1990s,
focusing mainly on trading market risk.

• Historical Method: The historical method re-organises actual historical returns, putting them in order from worst to best.

• The Variance-Covariance Method: This method assumes that stock returns are normally distributed and use pdf instead of actual returns.
