To manage risk, the target ceiling risk level was set to match the volatility of an unleveraged position in US equities. Essentially, positions were determined through optimization, constrained by volatility and other factors such as liquidity and position concentration. Consequently, leverage had to be exceptionally high, leading LTCM to hold assets four times larger than the next largest hedge fund."
